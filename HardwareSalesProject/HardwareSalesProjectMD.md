### The Outset

A computer hardware manufacturer is having problems meeting their sales targets. They enlist the help of a data analyst (that's me!) to define the problem and develop a strategy to
close the gap between where they are and where they want to be. In this project I will need to:

-Perform data discovery (collect the data, evaluate it, use multiple sources)
-Data cleaning (a data analysts bread & butter!)
-Data merging (combining datasets)
-Create visualisations (a dashboard!)

This dashboard, fully integrated with quality data, will allow the stakeholders to interact with the variables affected their sales problems. It will quickly and simply summarise 
possible solutions in visual format. SQL will be especially handy in getting this data ready to be imported into Power BI.

So let's examine the problem statement.

### Problem Statement

>(Skip to the section that looks like this for the short version)

AtliQ Hardware supplies computer hardware and peripherals to stores around India. They have a variety of clients - stores that supply their products. These clients include Surge Stores,
Nomad Stores, Excel Stores, and ElectricalSara Stores. AtliQ hardware has a primary office in Dehli and a variety of regional offices throughout India. A key stakeholder in AtliQ
is facing a lot of challenges. They are having issues tracking the sales insights in a dynamically growing market. They have regional managers for different areas of India and 
have concerns that verbal reports of sales progress are not accurate. Overall sales are declining but the verbal reports the stakeholder is receiving do not align with those facts. The regional
managers send massive Excel files but they are difficult to parse without visualisations.
The stakeholder wants to know where sales are declining and what the reason is so that solutions can be implemented. They have asked me to design a dashboard with a simple, digestible
visualisation of sales data, so they can reclaim the time they are spending on calling regional managers and get accurate information.

>How is the business doing in terms of sales?
>What are the biggest areas for improvement?
>Are the any insights from the data as to "why" sales have declined?
